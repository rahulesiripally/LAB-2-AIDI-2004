Decision trees are used by the ML model for Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) to determine if a breast tumour is benign or malignant depending on the features that were retrieved. To increase prediction accuracy, decision trees recursively partition the data based on useful features. The final model is interpretable, which facilitates comprehension and analysis of the decision-making procedure.
